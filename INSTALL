Installing Rumble should be easy. It uses Minero Aoki's setup.rb, so setup
is similar to most ruby packages:

	ruby setup.rb config
	ruby setup.rb setup
	ruby setup.rb install (this one as root)

Setting permissions is up to you. Rumble enforces no policy of its own.

After installing the program files, you must connect Rumble to your MTA. I
use exim, so that's what's documented at the moment.

There's more than one way to set up Rumble. A single list can be created
with a pipe setup in your aliases, like this:

	rumble: "|/usr/bin/rumble"
	mylist-l: "|/usr/bin/rumble"
	mylist-l-request: "|/usr/bin/rumble"

That's enough to get rumble itself going, and both the list and list request
addresses.  Now, tell Rumble about the list:

	rumble --newlist mylist-l@example.com

That's all there is to it.  You can subscribe and unsubscribe users with the
commandline, too:

	rumble --subscribe joe@example.org mylist-l@example.com

That's the simple way. It's not very scalable, though, if you have many
lists. For that sort of thing, you want to use a dedicated exim router, and
pick a set of addresses that will be passed on to Rumble. In my case, I use
a subdomain for the lists, so I have exim direct all the mail for that
domain to Rumble, and lets Rumble reject messages to invalid addresses.

	begin routers

	rumble:
		domain = lists.example.com
		transport = rumble

	begin transports

	rumble:
		driver = pipe
		command = "/usr/bin/rumble"
		user = rumble
		group = rumble


Enjoy.
