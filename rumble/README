Rumble is a simple, highly object-oriented mailing list manager, intended
first to interface well with Exim, and secondly with any MTA. The letters in
the name contain enough to make an acronym with words like "Ruby", "Mailing
List" and "Manage". The rest is your imagination.

The single entry point in normal usage is the program "rumble", usually
installed to /usr/bin. Invoked with no arguments, it expects a mail message
on standard input, which it will deliver to the list it is addressed to. If
the message is undeliverable, it will generate a failure notice on standard
output.

The rumble executable accepts the following options:

	--subscribe address lists
	--unsubscribe address lists
	--newlist list

Rumble is configured by a configuration file, /etc/mail/rumble.conf by
default.  The configuration file is a ruby script, so much is possible.
However, the basic configuration is performed with properties on the config
object like this:

	config.datadir = '/var/lib/rumble'

The properties available are documented in the Rumble::Configuration class.
You probably need to set these:

	config.smtpserver =  'yourmailhost'
	config.smtpport = 587
	config.smtpauthmethod = :login
	config.smtpusername = 'username'
	config.smtppassword = 'password'

And if your data directory is some place odd, or you have multiple
instances of Rumble handling different sets of lists, you need to set

	config.datadir = '/path/to/rumble/data'

Authorization to manage rumble is granted with operating system permissions.
Under Unix, create a group "rumble", and add users you wish to let
administer mailing lists to the group. Make Rumble's directory writable by
that group.  If you need more flexibility, the policy is yours to decide.
Rumble will not complain or try to make you do things its way.
